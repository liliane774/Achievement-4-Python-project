# Achievement-4-Python-project

You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze Instacart customer data to derive actionable insights by creating customer profiles, examining their regional distribution, and understanding their purchasing behavior across departments. The analysis aims to provide recommendations for targeted marketing strategies and product recommendations to enhance customer engagement and retention.

Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

Key Questions:
.Regional patterns in customer profiles?

.Departmental purchase patterns by profile? 

.Combine regional and departmental patterns for marketing?

.Customer profiles to prioritize for engagement?
 
.Optimize product recommendations?

.Potential areas for further analysis?

 Improve customer retention based on profiles?
 
 Stakeholders
 
● Vice President of Marketing: “We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”

● Senior Vice President of Sales: “We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”

● Instacart Customer: “I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly.”

Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.

Data
Throughout this Achievement, you’ll be using a number of open-source data sets from Instacart. You’ll also receive a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of this project), on which you’ll apply what you’ve learned to address the project’s key questions. While each data set contains a different kind of information, they all include some kind of common identifier. The project data you’ll need is linked for reference below. However, you’ll receive links to each data set in the Exercise content, as well.

Analysis Criteria

● Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.

● Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.

● Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).

● All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

● Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.

● All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes descriptive comments.

● All required data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

● Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking the top and the bottom of the data frame.

● Whenever a data frame is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its shape and basic statistics.

● All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.

● Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.

● All column names are self-explanatory.

● All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.

● Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.

● Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.

● All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a consistent naming convention.

● Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.

● Atleast 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.

● Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to customer information.

● Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.

● Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets
